    <h3>Who I am</h3>
    <p>
      Born and raised on Kauai, HI.  I am Kyle Kaimana Bulloch.  I have always
      been fascinated by how things work. From the smallest details of physics and
      chemistry to the big questions about the structure of the universe and the
      nature of consciousness, it can all be reduced to a set of logical rules.
      Writing code tickles my brain in just the right way, because it is deriving
      pure logic from a problem.  I love creating something out of nothing, adding
      to the entropy of the universe.  I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer
      currently studying at Epicodus.
